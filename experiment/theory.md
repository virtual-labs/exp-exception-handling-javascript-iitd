### THEORY
Handling errors in code and then executing them is known as exception handling.
We use 4 statements while handling exceptions:<br>
1.	Try- We use it in a block of code for errors.<br>
2.	Catch- This statement is used to handle the error detected in try statement. <br>
3.	Throw- It is used to create custom errors.<br>
4.	Finally- It is used to execute the code irrespective of the previous results.<br>
